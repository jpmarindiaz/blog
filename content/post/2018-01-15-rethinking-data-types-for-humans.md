Every visualization library out there would benefit a lot from having tidy representations for the input data formats they need. Whether it is geographical data or texts, identifying tidy data as the inputs for visualizations is a huge gain for the developers and the end users, validations can be more easily introduced and transition from one visualization software to other would be smoother if the visualizations had a common tidy data interface.
